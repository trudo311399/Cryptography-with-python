# Cryptography-with-python
Modern cryptography is the one used widely among computer science projects to secure the data messages. This tutorial covers how to implement cryptography using the Python scripting language.

This tutorial is meant for the end users who aspire to learn the basics of cryptography and its implementation in real world projects. This tutorial is also useful for networking professionals as well as hackers who want to implement new frameworks instead of following a traditional approach.

## Python Installation
The download link for Python language is www.python.org/downloads
